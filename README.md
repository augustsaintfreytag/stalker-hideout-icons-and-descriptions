# STALKER Hideout Icons & Descriptions

An aesthetic overhaul for hideout mods for STALKER Anomaly (Open X-Ray/Monolith engine), introducing a consistent design for icons and hand-edited descriptions for all items. Patches the base hideout mod and extensions. Covers the original *Hideout Furniture* mod by Aoldri, the *Hideout Furniture Expansion* mod by Maid, and the *Even More Hideout Furniture* mod by Facelessz.

## Features

The mod establishes a consistent design language where all props intended and exclusively usable with hideouts have a *packaged in cardboard* look. The mod includes new atlas textures where all hideout props are grouped together by the mod that adds them. It also includes a DLTX patch that updates texture reference, icon position, and dimensions for all items. Most new textures use the same origin position as the original items, some have changed dimensions.

Each box has a printed version of the item it contains on its side. The goal was to make hideout items instantly distinguishable from regular gameplay items, especially as many have equivalents (e.g. backpacks, spare parts, magazines). All icons were painstakingly hand-made by me in Photoshop.
